# lightweight_automation_firefox
**Overview** 
Direct good quality traffic to any website. A Selenium Python based Firefox driver setup that allows for 75 tabs open at once on my server computer (Specs: 16g RAM, i7, SSD)

**Instructions To Run** 
This project is very straightforward to setup and run.
  1. Make sure to download the latest version of ChromeDriver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and put it in the same directory as traffic.py.
  2. Add proxies to your proxies.txt in the format "ip:port". Each new line will be treated as a new proxy.
  3. Configure your username and password for proxies (if any) in the "initdriver" function.
  4. Run Traffic.py and follow the input prompts.
  5. Enjoy!
